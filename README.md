## Overview
Similar to the original plants vs zombies, the zombies are trying to get into the house(on the left) to eat the user's brain. In order to defend yourself against the zombie attack, the user needs to get plants defend the house.
The Plants are:
Sunflower: produces sun (each sun is worth 25)
Peashooter: shoots peas, damaging zombies on the same lane
Walnut: neutral but have a lot of health
PotatoMine: one time use and needs some time to prepare, but does a ton of damage on one grid;
Cherrybomb: one time use and does a ton of damage in a 3x3 grid

The Zombies are:
Normal Zombie: averge zombie with average speed with average damage
Football Zombie: faster zombie with more health
Dance Zombie: slightly more health than average zombie and is able to spawn normal zombies around it
## Instructions
In this game, like the original plants vs zombies, the user will have to hover on the "suns" to get the currency. Once the user saved enough suns (shown on the top left), the user can click on seed packets (on the top) and click somewhere on the lawn to place the plant. If the user does not like the location of the plant, they can click on the shovel (top right corner) and click on a plant on the lawn to remove it. Beware, the user does not get the sun back.
